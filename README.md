# Assignment 4 ENSF 381

An assignment to mess around with HTML and CSS. Some things still need fixing, but we don't worry about that. To be fix later:
    -> Shrinking the height of the web
        -  footer and profile picture merge into other contianers
    -> Clean up html code (possibly lessen the css needed)
    -> Probably some other bugs? no clue :^)
